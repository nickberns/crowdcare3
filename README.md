# Environment-friendly initiatives funding empowered by eosio blockchain

This repository is a reupload of a repository initially submitted by @RalfWeinand. This DAPP was submitted to the EOS by Team "Crowdcare" at the EOS Hackathon in Sydney on 5th August 2018. 

### Team members: Ralf Weinand, Nikolai Berns, Jack Shi, Kane Parker and Nathan Birch. 

CrowdCare is an innovative DAPP that allows conscious users to propose, vote on and fund environmental initiatives, such as cleaning up a beach. Like minded users can connect and vote for initiatives that the community cares about and come together to make a real difference, one project at a time. Taking advantage of EOSIO blockchain features, our platform is truly transparent and restores the trust users have lost in traditional charities and NGOs. It is decentralized, and allows the funding from people who care to be utilized by people who are passionate - without a middleman. The efficient underlying protocol means it can start as a local community DAPP and be scaled to worldwide adoption with ease. But most importantly - it incentivizes people to make a positive impact on our world.
